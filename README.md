# Parasite Eve Databank

A fun project built for one of my favorite video games of all time.
This application serves as documentation for the game providing information on various
assets such as its characters, weapons, armor, abilities, etc. The technologies used includes
TypeScript and vanilla CSS.

This application will continue to be updated and worked on over time.

TypeScript is set up to be compiled into JavaScript into the "dist" directory using the following script:

`npm run build`
